"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2943668",Classification of legal texts,"It is of great importance for procedure retrieval to find an effective classification method of Chinese legal documents with deep semantic understanding, as the electronic documents of Chinese law have massive volume and complex structure. In this paper, a method for learning Chinese legal document classification using Graph LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) combined with domain knowledge extraction is proposed. First, the judicial domain model is constructed based on ontologies that include top-level ontology and domain-specific ontology. Second, the legal documents are divided into different knowledge blocks through top-level ontology and domain-specific ontology. Third, information is extracted from the knowledge blocks according to the legal domain model and stored in XML files. At last, Graph LSTM is applied for classification. The experiments show that compared with the traditional classification methods of support vector machine (SVM) and LSTM, Graph LSTM has higher classification accuracy and better classification performance."
"10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342650",Classification of legal texts,"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has been prominent and ongoing research over many different domains, but it is not widely discussed in the legal domain. A number of publicly available datasets for a wide range of domains usually fulfill the needs of researchers to perform their studies in the field of ABSA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset for the Aspect (Party) Based Sentiment Analysis for legal opinion texts. Therefore, creating a publicly available dataset for the research of ABSA for the legal domain can be considered as a task with significant importance. In this study, we introduce a manually annotated legal opinion text dataset (SigmaLaw-ABSA) intended towards facilitating researchers for ABSA tasks in the legal domain. SigmaLaw-ABSA consists of legal opinion texts in the English language which have been annotated by human judges. This study discusses the sub-tasks of ABSA relevant to the legal domain and how to use the dataset to perform them. This paper also describes the statistics of the dataset and as a baseline, we present some results on the performance of some existing deep learning based systems on the SigmaLaw-ABSA dataset."
"10.1109/KSE.2019.8919370",Legal argumentation mining,"In a court document, the rhetorical status of a sentence conveys the intention of the sentence, whether is is a claim or contains supporting evidences, thus, is beneficial to court document processing systems, for example, court document retrieval systems. Besides, rhetorical structure analysis has high-impact applications in natural language processing, for instances, text summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering. The output structures of the analysis contain high-level relationship between clauses and so provides valuable information. Despite of a wide range of applications and the necessity for automatic court document processing, automatic rhetorical structure analysis has not been well noticed in the legal domain. We propose to use deep learning models for tackling the task of recognizing the rhetorical status of each sentence in a court document. Deep learning has been shown effective towards natural language processing tasks including discourse analysis. We have achieved promising results for the task, which suggests the applicability of artificial neural module embedding rhetorical information for other tasks, for example, summarization and information retrieval."
"10.1109/KSE.2016.7758062",Legal information extraction,"This paper proposes neural networks approaches to recognize logical parts in Vietnamese legal documents. We utilize four models based on recurrent neural networks including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM and their combination with Conditional Random Fields. The experimental results on the Vietnamese Business Law data set shows the promising of this approach. Although, these approaches don't use any engineering features like traditional approaches, they can produce the state-of-the-art performance."
"10.1109/ICACSIS51025.2020.9263157",Legal information extraction,"The increasing number of Indonesian court decision documents requires special attention to be managed and used efficiently. One thing is to recognize legal entities to identify relevant legal information in the documents. This research examines the effectiveness of several deep learning methods, to recognize ten legal entities in Indonesian court decision documents. In this task, we found that the combination of Bi-LSTM and CRF methods achieve the highest F-1 score of 0.83. It outperforms other deep learning methods (CNN, LSTM, LSTM+CRF and Bi-LSTM) by 2 - 12 % and machine learning methods (SVM and CRF) by 41 - 76 %. The results show that this model can be used to identify relevant information about the legal domain in Indonesia."
"10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006182",Legal information retrieval,"Predictive Coding, also called Text Categorization, has been widely used in legal industry. By leveraging machine learning models such as logistic regression and SVM, the review of documents can be prioritized based on their probability of relevance to the legal case, thus improving review efficiency and cutting cost. In recent years, deep learning models-combined with word embeddings-have shown better performance in predictive coding. However, deep learning models involve many parameters and it is challenging and time-consuming for legal practitioners to select appropriate settings. Based on the experiments on several public legal text datasets, this paper shows the preliminary results about how various key parameter settings impact the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)."
"10.1109/QRS-C.2019.00038",Legal judgement prediction,"Under the blessing of artificial intelligence technology, legal research is moving towards intelligent and automated. The analysis of judicial data through artificial intelligence methods has become an urgent demand. High-efficient use of data in the judiciary can reduce the burden on relevant personnel, improve the case-handling efficiency, enhance trial quality, and promote fair enforcement. In order to solve the problem of automatic sentencing in legal intelligence, this paper proposes a framework based on FastText and TextCNN to combine the deep learning with justice to predict accusation, converting accusation prediction into a multi-label text classification problem. Compared to traditional methods and machine learning models, our framework can achieve excellent performance."
"10.1109/ICSSIT48917.2020.9214278",Legal judgement prediction,"All courts in India publish judgment by statistically analyzing the data of different cases and understanding the verdict from precedents judgments and the statute law. The approach of our study is to highlight the importance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the legal domain. The Bag of Words technique is being proposed i.e., one of the NLP tool to analyze the text of the court proceedings to extract the keywords from the text and CNN to classify each case into its charges (as per judicial law of India), to predict whether it is a bailable or a non-bailable offence and to give an approximate judicial decision. The results show that this method has an average accuracy of 85% in prediction based on the IPC (Indian Penal Code) which is extracted from the case files. This research work data is taken from the judicial pronouncement and the constitution of India."
"10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00116",Legal knowledge base management,"The Supreme Court Database provided by Washington University (in St. Louis) School of Law is an essential legal research tool. The Supreme Court Database is organized and categorized to Issue Areas to make it easy for legal researchers to find on-point cases for an area of law. This paper used a semi-supervised learning approach to automatically categorize the Supreme Court's opinions to Issue Areas. An inductive method of clustering then labeling approach was used by employing a nonmetric space of a fast Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph index containing USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) embeddings. After obtaining the labels from the semi-supervised approach, we evaluate several classification approaches to use with the data achieving the weighted average F1-Scores: SVM with Max Norm Features 0.75, RNN 0.78, and BERT 0.68."
"10.1109/NICS51282.2020.9335906",Legal question answering,"Recently, with the development of NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods and Deep Learning, there are several solutions to the problems in question answering systems that achieve superior results. However, there are not many solutions to question-answering systems in the Vietnamese legal domain. In this research, we propose an answer selection approach by fine-tuning the BERT language model on our Vietnamese legal question-answer pair corpus and achieve an 87% F1-Score. We further pre-train the original BERT model on a Vietnamese legal domain-specific corpus and achieve a higher F1-Score than the original BERT at 90.6% on the same task, which could reveal the potential of a new pre-trained language model in the legal area."
