During the last 5 years DL became the primary Artificial Intelligence (AI) method in the legal domain. In this work we provide a systematic bibliometric review of the publications that have utilized DL as the primary methodology. In particular we analyzed the performed objectives (performed tasks), the corpus utilized to train the models and promising areas of research. The sample includes a total of 137 works published between 1987 and 2020. This analysis starts with the first DL models (formerly Neural Networks) in the legal domain until the latest articles in the ongoing year. Our results show an increment of 300% on the total number of publications during the last 5 years, mainly on information extraction and classification tasks. Moreover, classification is the category with most publications with 39% of the total sample. Finally, we have identified that summarization and text generation as promising areas of research. These findings show that DL in the legal domain is currently in a growing stage, and hence it will be a promising topic of research in the coming years.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-9012-9","10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346339","Legal Corpus;Deep Learning;Neural Networks","Deep learning;Law;Bibliometrics;Natural language processing;Data models;Task analysis;Artificial intelligence","artificial intelligence;deep learning (artificial intelligence);information analysis;natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","legal domain;deep Learning;1987-2020;total sample;ongoing year;DL models;performed objectives;primary methodology;systematic bibliometric review;primary Artificial Intelligence method;5 years DL;Natural Language Processing;Deep Learning","","","","61","","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, within the context of case law, it has never been used in conjunction with precedent to rank case laws. This paper presents the CaseRank algorithm, a case law ranking algorithm based on PCA, and precedent. PCA is used to compute rankings, and court precedent is used to enforce court authority over these rankings, since courts do not enjoy the same authority in ruling. Current systems overlook the effect of precedent in case law social clusters. However, literature, together with legal experts, show that precedent plays a huge role in case law. A search engine is built to demonstrate the usefulness of CaseRank, but more importantly, the rankings. The CaseRank algorithm is general and easily adaptable to case law of any country or region, which eliminates territorial or context-based legal factors of different countries or regions. The rankings of case law are found to be logically correct in an objective/general sense. Furthermore, CaseRank provides a basis for future big data legal research, within the context of searching, and ranking.","","978-1-5386-1001-5","10.1109/ICTAS.2018.8368765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368765","Link analysis;case law;principal component analysis;stare decisis","Law;Principal component analysis;Clustering algorithms;Recommender systems;Tools;Web pages","law administration;principal component analysis;search engines","court precedent;case law social clusters;CaseRank algorithm;principal component analysis;social graph data;case law ranking algorithm;search engine;big data legal research","","","","23","","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to solve this problem, this paper designs a classification method of legal texts based on feature words. Firstly, the relationship between legal provisions and characteristic words is established by taking the legal judgment documents as the training corpus, since the relevant legal provisions can be extracted accurately in the judgment documents. Then the characteristic words of the documents can be calculated by TF-IDF so it will be easy to establish corresponding relationship between legal provisions and the characteristic words. The chi-square statistic(CHI) and the position of feature words in the text are introduced as correction factors and integrated with traditional TF-IDF weight formula, which solve the problem of the distribution of feature words between classes and the insufficient importance of keywords. The experiments show that the algorithm can extract feature words from a variety of legal texts, and classify them into corresponding legal terms through calculation, so the classification effect of legal texts is proved to be excellent.","","978-1-7281-1307-4","10.1109/ICITBS.2019.00059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669581","TF-IDF;legal text;classification retrieval;CHI","Conferences;Transportation;Big Data;Smart cities","feature extraction;information retrieval;pattern classification;statistical analysis;text analysis","characteristic words;feature words;classification retrieval approach;English legal texts;legal judgment documents;relevant legal provisions;legal terms;legal provisions;chi-square statistic","","2","","11","","21 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Problems of visualization of texts of legal acts as a graphical presentation of the values and relations of attributes in analyzed legal text are discussed.

The purpose of the system is to satisfy a user's specific retrieval requirement by finding the best response to his request.","","978-1-4799-4143-8","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927573","legal ontology learning;query reformulation mechanism;legal information retrieval system","Ontologies;Law;Context;Information retrieval;Semantics;Pragmatics","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query formulation;query processing;user interfaces","legal ontology;user queries satisfaction;Arabic ontology learning process;Tunisian legal texts;legal information retrieval;search process;user profile;query reformulation mechanism","","3","","12","","20 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electronic justice is an essential part of e- Administration within the justice field for shaping a modern public administration of justice, and openness in public services is becoming more and more a key concept. In this paper, we show a projection of these concepts in a new software introduced as a real case, deployed and put into operation in a court of last instance. A closer and more citizen-centric approach has been the starting point for development and can be a model for promoting research in e-justice for all audiences, experts and amateurs. This work provides an innovative vision of e-justice ICT based on the concept of closer to citizens as a key element in the development of ICT in legal issues. For this purpose the factors that make electronic justice is introduced, putting in context the research in the legal field and how a more open justice with the citizen as the first requirement for a judicial system can be considered.

This paper details how developing production rule models can aid in acquiring software requirements from regulatory texts. Production rules enable requirements engineers to gain valuable domain knowledge of a particular legal text by providing the ability to receive precise answers to a specific query. In particular, a production rule model facilitates communication between requirements engineers and legal domain experts, supports and augments requirements elicitation, and resolves ambiguity. Prior work in this area has failed to detail a precise methodology for translating a legal text into production rules, and considered using production rule models for aiding requirements elicitation and validation. This paper introduces our production rule modeling methodology, and demonstrates this methodology using examples from a production rule model for four sections of the U.S. Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).","2332-6441","978-0-7695-3761-0","10.1109/RE.2009.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328596","Requirements engineering;regulatory compliance;production rule modeling;logic programming","Production;Law;Legal factors;Insurance;Privacy;Knowledge engineering;Costs;Government;Protection;Legislation","law;software engineering;systems analysis","production rule models;requirements engineering;legal texts;regulatory compliance;software requirements;domain knowledge;requirements elicitation","","34","","31","","17 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The output structures of the analysis contain high-level relationship between clauses and so provides valuable information.

Therefore, an adaptive retrieval method of legal information based on artificial intelligence is proposed. First, establish a positional legal language model to determine the total number of spreads in the term. According to the definition of the term in the model, calculate the similarity of the semantic concept of the term. After confirming that the concept is similar to the term, calculate the co-occurring words in the term. Finally, an artificial intelligence algorithm is used to retrieve the co-occurring words. In order to verify the feasibility of the designed retrieval method, literature [1], literature [2] and design methods were used to retrieve the contents of a certain legal information database.

Courts generate an enormous amount of unstructured text on a daily basis. Extraction of the desired information from this unstructured legal text is one of the major issues. So, there is a need to develop an intelligent system that can automatically find useful and critical information from the available text. Such a system will help judges and lawyers in their judgments and case preparations, common people in understanding law, and finding appropriate lawyer for their legal issues. Therefore, in this research, Punjab University Legal Mining System (PULMS) is developed using three different supervised machine learning algorithms; conditional random field (CRF), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), and trigram N tag (TNT). To train the system, 304 criminal miscellaneous judgments of the Lahore High Court (LHC) of Pakistan are manually tagged for nine named entities (NE). After training, among three machine learning algorithms, the system achieved significant precision, recall, and f-measure using CRF which are 0.97, 0.87, and 0.89, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8709665","Legal text mining;information extraction;named entity recognition;legal proceedings;criminal judgments","Law;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Large Hadron Collider;Hidden Markov models;Organizations","data mining;law administration;maximum entropy methods;random processes;supervised learning;text analysis","criminal judgments;unstructured legal text;intelligent system;legal issues;Punjab University Legal Mining System;conditional random field;CRF;maximum entropy;trigram N tag;information mining;supervised machine learning algorithms;Lahore High Court;named entities","","2","","17","","8 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We investigate the use of information retrieval techniques to enable automated identification of similar cases and evaluate if semantic search performs better than lexical search in the task of assisting legal opinion writing. As a proof of concept, syntactic indexing (TF-IDF and BM25) and semantic indexing (Latent Semantic Indexing - LSI and Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA) techniques were evaluated using document collections from two public prosecutors offices. In addition, we evaluate model enrichment with the use of recorded data about the cases, and also with the legal norm citations observed in documents. Baseline document collections sampled from full document collection from two public prosecutors offices were used for model evaluation utilizing Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain (NDCG) as metric. We conclude that there is no significant performance difference between semantic and syntactic indexing techniques. In addition, we observe no significant performance gain with model enrichment. We chose the BM25 technique as more adequate because it has a good balance between performance and simplicity.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999300","Legal Information Retrieval, Topic Modeling, Semantic Search","Law;Semantics;Information retrieval;Indexing;Task analysis;Large scale integration","citation analysis;document handling;indexing;information retrieval;law","semantic search;lexical search;criminal cases;information retrieval techniques;syntactic indexing;latent semantic indexing;latent dirichlet allocation;document collection;public prosecutors offices;legal norm citations;BM25 technique;legal opinion writing assistance;normalized discounted cumulated gain;federal district;LSI;LDA;TF-IDF;NDCG;territories","","","","13","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The production of relevant documents to opposing counsel, however, is typically made on a family basis (an email and all its attachments), such that the entire family is produced as a collective unit. Counsel's ethical responsibility to prevent the disclosure of privileged information necessitates review of every document in every family being produced. Consequently, it is standard industry practice to batch entire families for review together. This work examines the overall review ordering and efficiency of alternative techniques for managing review leading to the production of relevant document families while fully protecting privilege. Batching, document sequencing, and therefore, training of the core supervised machine learning (AI) algorithm differ among each protocol, and lead to different overall efficiencies. Our empirical results support two conclusions. First, break up the family. In every instance, broken family retrieval protocols are more efficient than full family protocols. Second, a carefully designed and implemented dual phase workflow incorporating an initial, expedited relevance review can be more efficient than a single phase workflow, even if some documents are reviewed twice.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622323","eDiscovery;legal information retrieval;document review protocols;privileged data protection","Protocols;Machine learning algorithms;Task analysis;Law;Industries","document handling;information retrieval;law administration;supervised learning","broken family retrieval protocols;dual phase workflow;efficient recall-oriented retrieval;legally-necessitated dual constraints;review ordering;document sequencing;supervised machine learning algorithm;document families;eDiscovery;full family protocols","","","","12","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle. This paper surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. These efforts include the use of symbolic logic, logic programming, first-order temporal logic, deontic logic, defeasible logic, goal modeling, and semi-structured representations. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors to better specify, monitor, and test software systems for compliance.","2332-6441","978-0-7695-2935-6","10.1109/RE.2007.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384161","","Law;Legal factors;Logic programming;Monitoring;Government;Information security;Legislation;Software systems;Computer science;Systems engineering and theory","logic programming;program testing;temporal logic;text analysis","requirements engineering;legal texts;system development;monitoring systems;domain-specific definitions;cross-references;software lifecycle;symbolic logic;logic programming;first-order temporal logic;deontic logic;goal modeling;semistructured representations;test software systems","","89","","47","","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rules about admissibility and the licensing requirements for forensic professionals must also be taken into account. The use of digital data in an expanding number of US court cases and business investigations has precipitated changes in evidence handling and admissibility requirements, most notably in the 2006 changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Knowledge of these rules and the ensuing case law is an essential component of any examiner's toolkit because improper evidence handling can lead to inadmissible evidence. The court's acceptance of such evidence is also greatly affected by the examiner's proper licensure. Unfortunately, these requirements vary by state (sometimes even by city) and are constantly changing. Therefore, digital forensic investigators must heed both the court's rules regarding evidence handling and the state's rules for licensing in order to be most effective.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSP.2009.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812156","digital forensics;licensing;investigator;investigation;security","Licenses;Law;Legal factors;Digital forensics;Guidelines;Testing;Security;Privacy;Pharmaceuticals;Protection","forensic science;legislation","licensing;legal issue;digital forensic;digital information;forensic professional;digital data;US court case;evidence handling;admissibility requirement;Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;case law;inadmissible evidence","","2","","8","","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An important part of intensified efforts towards better privacy protection is enterprise workflow (re)design. In particular, the GDPR as strengthen the imperative to apply the privacy by design principle when (re)designing workflows. A conforming and promising approach is to model privacy relevant workflow fragments as Workflow Privacy Patterns (WPPs). Such WPPs allow to specify abstract templates for recurring data-privacy problems in workflows. Thus, WPPs are intended to support workflow engineers, auditors and privacy officers by providing pre-validated patterns that comply with existing data privacy regulations. However, it is unclear yet how to obtain WPPs systematically with an appropriate level of detail. In this paper, we introduce our approach to derive WPPs from legal texts and similar normative regulations. We propose a structure of a WPP, which we derive from pattern approaches from other research areas. We also introduce a framework that allows to design WPPs which make legal regulations accessible for persons who do not possess in-depth legal expertise. We have applied our approach to different articles of the GDPR, and we have obtained evidence that we can transfer legal text into a structured WPP representation. If a workflow correctly implements a WPP that has been designed that way, the workflow automatically complies to the respective fragment of the underlying legal text.","2300-5963","978-83-952357-8-8","10.15439/2019F275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8859981","","Law;Privacy;Adaptation models;General Data Protection Regulation","business data processing;data protection;legislation;text analysis;workflow management software","legal documents;GDPR;privacy protection;privacy relevant workflow fragments;WPPs;data-privacy problems;pre-validated patterns;data privacy regulations;legal text;pattern approaches;legal regulations;general data protection regulation;workflow privacy patterns;enterprise workflow design","","1","","20","","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, no research has determined whether software engineers are able to identify and classify important ambiguities in laws and regulations. Ambiguities in legal texts can make the difference between requirements compliance and non-compliance. Herein, we develop a ambiguity taxonomy based on software engineering, legal, and linguistic understandings of ambiguity. We examine how 17 technologists and policy analysts in a graduate-level course use this taxonomy to identify ambiguity in a legal text. We also examine the types of ambiguities they found and whether they believe those ambiguities should prevent software engineers from implementing software that complies with the legal text. Our research suggests that ambiguity is prevalent in legal texts. In 50 minutes of examination, participants in our case study identified on average 33.47 ambiguities in 104 lines of legal text using our ambiguity taxonomy as a guideline. Our analysis suggests (a) that participants used the taxonomy as intended: as a guide and (b) that the taxonomy provides adequate coverage (97.5%) of the ambiguities found in the legal text.","2332-6441","978-1-4799-3033-3","10.1109/RE.2014.6912250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912250","","Law;Software;Taxonomy;Context;Tutorials;Pragmatics","computer science education;educational courses;software engineering","regulatory requirements;software engineers;software systems;software requirements;graduate-level software engineering students;ambiguity taxonomy;linguistic understandings;policy analysts;graduate-level course","","34","","34","","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system processes the queries by extracting relevant keywords and discards those that do not carry much information and then returns the relevant sections of law which contain these keywords or keyphrases. The system also returns a list of relevant Supreme Court cases. The user can decide on the number of results to be displayed. The user can also wish to have only the name of the relevant acts be displayed for certain keywords or keyphrases. The system does not require the user to know how the law is structured or how the knowledge-base is built in order to benefit from it. The portal can also be accessed via mobile devices without compromising any of its facilities or user-friendliness.

Research related to electronic signatures is briefly divided into two areas, namely cryptography and legal research. In the area of cryptography, it focuses on security notions of signature schemes. In the area of legal research, it focuses on the legal framework to facilitate the use of electronic signatures, especially for the applications of electronic commerce. However, research studies are rarely cross-reference to each other. From a legal perspective, an electronic signature must satisfy specific requirements in order to be recognized in law. In this paper, we propose an assessment framework for cryptographic signature schemes based on the legal requirements for electronic signatures. We further carry out the assessment for several cryptographic signature schemes and find a failure of a well-recognized scheme. It means that electronic signatures from such scheme are not likely to be recognized in law. To our best knowledge, our study is the first research work to address the interaction between legal requirements for electronic signatures and cryptographic signature schemes.","","978-1-4799-3503-1","10.1109/PST.2014.6890955","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890955","Electronic Signature;UN Model Law;EU Directive 1999/93/EC;UETA;RSA Signature;Ring Signature;Group Signature;Proxy Signature;Blind Signature","Law;Reliability;Public key;Joining processes","cryptography;digital signatures;electronic commerce;law","cryptographic signature scheme assessment;legal perspective;handwritten signatures;electronic signatures;legal research;signature scheme security notions;legal framework;electronic commerce","","","","19","","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A high-quality knowledge graph is handy for building a high-performance knowledge-driven application. Despite recent advances in information extraction (IE) techniques, no suitable automated methods can be applied to constructing a domain-specific, comprehensive, and high-quality knowledge graph. However, a semi-automatic strategy, which can ensure the basic quality requirements of a knowledge graph, has been successfully implemented in the elementary science domain. This paper presents a semantic annotation system developed for building a high-quality legal knowledge graph (SALKG) using the semi-automatic strategy. We introduce its system design, architecture, algorithms, functions, and implementation. To investigate the effectiveness of SALKG, we conduct a preliminary annotation experiment with 280 legal texts which were collected from the Harvard Caselaw Access Project. The user evaluation from 32 graduate students demonstrates the high usability of SALKG in semantic annotation and the potential for building a high-quality legal knowledge graph. The system can also be adapted to other fields for constructing domain-specific knowledge graphs.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378107","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378107","Semantic Annotation;Knowledge Graph;Legal Text;Annotation System","Law;Annotations;Semantics;Big Data;Tools;Usability;System analysis and design","","","","","","33","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of complex and voluminous legal text can benefit from the automation and traceability of logic-based models. We propose such a model based on norms. Norms are legal rights and associated duties expressed in regulatory documents. Such norm models help reason about available rights and required duties based on the satisfiability of situations, a state-of-affair, in a given scenario. But model extraction from natural language as well as compliance reasoning in complex scenarios needs subject matter expertise. Our method enables modular norm model extraction and reasoning. For extraction, using the theory of frame-semantics we construct two foundational norm templates that cover Hohfeld's concepts of claim-right and its jural correlative, duty. Template instantiations from legal text result in a repeatable method for extraction of modular norm models. For reasoning, we introduce the notion of a super-situation. Super-situations contain other norm models. Compliance results from a modular norm are propagated to its containing super-situation, which in turn participates in other modular norms. This modularity allows on-demand incremental modeling and reasoning using simpler model primitives than previous approaches.","","978-1-5386-1956-8","10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328459","Frame semantics;Hohfeld rights;applicability;satisfiability;norms;laws;compliance","Law;Cognition;Semantics;Natural language processing;Analytical models;Privacy","data privacy;law administration;natural languages;security of data","modular norm models;legal compliance;legal regulatory requirements;critical software systems;voluminous legal text;legal rights;compliance reasoning;modular norm model extraction;foundational norm templates;on-demand incremental modeling;privacy;security","","","","25","","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, legal texts often express obligations only indirectly, for example, by attributing a right to the counterpart. This phenomenon has already been described in the Requirements Engineering (RE) literature [1]. Objectives: We investigate the use of requirements templates for the systematic elicitation of legal requirements. Our work is motivated by two observations: (1) The existing literature does not provide a harmonized view on the requirements templates that are useful for legal RE; (2) Despite the promising recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automated support for legal RE through the suggestion of requirements templates has not been achieved yet. Our objective is to take steps toward addressing these limitations. Methods: We review and reconcile the legal requirement templates proposed in RE. Subsequently, we conduct a qualitative study to define NLP rules for template recommendation. Results and Conclusions: Our contributions consist of (a) a harmonized list of requirements templates pertinent to legal RE, and (b) rules for the automatic recommendation of such templates. We evaluate our rules through a case study on 400 statements from two legal domains. The results indicate a recall and precision of 82,3% and 79,8%, respectively. We show that introducing some limited interaction with the analyst considerably improves accuracy. Specifically, our human-feedback strategy increases recall by 12% and precision by 10,8%, thus yielding an overall recall of 94,3% and overall precision of 90,6%.","2332-6441","978-1-7281-7438-9","10.1109/RE48521.2020.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218171","Legal Requirements;Requirements Templates;AI-assisted RE;Natural Language Processing","Law;Stakeholders;Metadata;Semantics;Linguistics;Natural language processing","formal specification;formal verification;information retrieval;law administration;natural language processing;systems analysis;text analysis","legal requirements elicitation;legal texts;requirements engineering;legal requirement templates;template recommendation;natural language processing","","","","33","","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following an action research method, we successfully collaborated with the Government of Luxembourg in transitioning five major legislative codes from plain-text to a legal markup format. Our work focused on generating markup for the structural elements of the underlying codes. The technical basis for our work is an adaptation and enhancement of an academic markup generation tool developed in our prior research [1]. We reflect on the experience gained from applying automated markup generation at large scales. In particular, we elaborate the decisions we made in order to strike a cost-effective balance between automation and manual work for legal markup generation.

The findings revealed that existing studies did not present models to specifically recommend the most applied case, nor did they indicate database methods to store and query legal documents. The model was derived based on the findings from the literature review and extended to include the adoption of a graph database for information storage. A case study approach was used to empirically test the concepts. Testing was limited to a small number of documents as proof of concept and future research will test for scalability. The model can contribute to the research community in the fields of information retrieval, information extraction, database retrieval methods, as well as the legal domain.

Current approaches lack an intermediate, domain-specific representation that fosters reuse and is technology-agnostic. In this paper, such a pattern-based approach is developed to formalize compliance requirements in the food industry. The contributions of this paper are twofold.

Regulations contain obligations that must be fulfilled by healthcare systems that form the backbone of modern healthcare. In this paper, we present a model for extracting and deconstructing obligations. The Obligation Model allows for capturing the essence of obligations in terms of their attributes such as Responsible entity, Trigger, Action, Deadline and Reference. We augment the extracted obligations with auxiliary information present in regulation documents and provide an ownership based rendering of the deconstructed obligation in an HTML format. This helps in establishing an explicit ownership of obligations and contributes towards enhancing accountability of stakeholders towards fulfilling the obligations. The rendering will be useful for building compliant healthcare systems by making the legal text more comprehensible for system designers.","","978-1-7281-2251-9","10.1109/SEH.2019.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823886","Obligation, HIPAA, Healthcare, Extraction, Machine Learning, Ownership based rendering","Medical services;Rendering (computer graphics);Data mining;Law;Linguistics;Stakeholders","health care;hypermedia markup languages;medical information systems;rendering (computer graphics)","healthcare regulations;HTML format;legal text;ownership based rendering;obligation model;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act;multiple stakeholders;healthcare ecosystem;system designers;regulation documents","","","","22","","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the number of phrases that serve to define this boundary in a legal statement are usually large and often a simple legal statement contains or is affected by up to 10 definition-related phrases. In addition, software designers may need to design their software to operate under multiple jurisdictions, which may not use the same terminology to express conditions. Thus, it is necessary for designers to keep track of definitions in one or more regulations and to compare these definitions across jurisdictions. In this paper we report a study to develop a method to analyze and compare natural language definitions across legal texts and how to analyze the legal statements with respect to definitions. Our method helps reduce the number of comparison between definitions across multiple jurisdictions as well as allows software designers keep track of several inter-related definitions in a systematic way.","","978-1-5090-0104-0","10.1109/RELAW.2015.7330211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7330211","Privacy;Legal Ontology;Definitions;Legal Requirements","Law;Ontologies;Software;Cognition;Public healthcare","law;software engineering;text analysis","multijurisdiction;law;natural language;legal text analysis","","1","","23","","19 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing case law stipulates that probable cause requires less than 50% certainty in a suspect’s involvement in a crime, and that it should be applied consistently regardless of the crime at hand or type of search in question. Because courts have previously declared probable cause to be a ‘lay’ judgement, this experiment investigated whether lay perceptions of the probable cause standard align with the legal guidelines surrounding it. We assigned 406 respondents to read various scenarios varying by crime (assault, narcotics or robbery) and intrusiveness of search (person, car or home), and judge whether a police officer would be justified in conducting a search. Case law suggests that search decisions should not generally depend on the nature of the crime at hand, but may depend on the invasiveness of the search being conducted. Results suggested that respondents generally made their search decisions in line with these principles, but that they implicitly assumed probable cause to require ‘more’ certainty in a suspect’s crime involvement than case law would prescribe. We discuss the implications of these findings for the perceived fairness of police procedures and its impact on police–community relations.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgy010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8488891","probable cause;lay judgements;search and seizure;public perceptions","","","","","","","","","11 Oct 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Court inefficiency has been well acknowledged for many decades. Yet, the crucial question “How bad are they? ” has never been answered. For many different reasons, almost all legal research carried out in Brazil has been subjective, relying entirely on conventional wisdom and anecdoctal evidence. The purpose of this paper is to try to address the lack of empirical research on the performance of the Brazilian judiciary. We employ data envelopment analysis to measure the efficiency of Brazilian state courts. Results show that relative efficiency varies substantially across the 27 state courts in the country. Moreover, we will also argue that the lack of human and material resources cannot be blamed as the main reason for inefficiency, as it is traditionally believed. Finally, there seems to be some evidence that court efficiency is correlated with the performance of court management. In other words, efficient courts are those that exhibit better management.","1471-6798","","10.1093/imaman/dpr002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8133763","data envelopment analysis (DEA);efficiency;courts","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Specially, there are some text analysis tasks with judgment reports, such as analyzing the criminal process and predicting prison terms. Traditional researches on text analysis are generally based on special feature selection and ontology model generation or require legal experts to provide external knowledge. All these methods require a lot of time and labor costs. Therefore, in this paper, we use textual data such as judgment reports creatively to perform prison term prediction without external legal knowledge. We propose a framework that combines value-based rules and a fuzzy text to predict the target prison term. The procedure in our framework includes information extraction, term fuzzification, and document vector regression. We carry out experiments with real-world judgment reports and compare our model's performance with those of ten traditional classification and regression models and two deep learning models. The results show that our model achieves competitive results compared with other models as evaluated by the RMSE and R-squared metrics. Finally, we implement a prototype system with a user-friendly GUI that can be used to predict prison terms according to the legal text inputted by the user.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2020.06.017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122650","judgment content understanding;pre-trained model;fuzzification;content representation vectors","Predictive models;Feature extraction;Law;Natural language processing;Text analysis","feature selection;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;text analysis;vectors","document vector regression;fuzzy attention neural network;deep learning;classification models;term fuzzification;information extraction;value-based rules;ontology model;feature selection;text analysis;textual content prediction","","","","","","22 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In conformity with the global tendency, balancing is increasingly used in judicial practice as an argumentation technique for solving legal disputes; more and more, judges of all levels ground their decisions on the balancing of individual rights, interests, principles, needs, and values. Legal science has formulated theoretical and formal models to explain the argumentation structure of balancing and the criteria governing the argumentation process, but, in the absence of a conceptual model that encompasses all elements in play and enables a comparative mechanism to be abstracted, mapping instances of judicial practice to abstract theories is still difficult. In this context, the objective of the project described here is to allow the logic of judicial practice emerge from cases, verifying from the bottom up the assumptions of theoretical models. Starting off from a broad analysis of Italian cases, the paper aims at analysing the object of this operation, i.e. what is `balanced' and what is the nature of this process. The research was conducted by analysing the so-called `massime' (case law abstracts) of the Italian High Courts (Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, Council of State) of the administrative courts (Regional Administrative Tribunals) and of a selection of lower court decisions. The methodology is divided into an initial phase of documentary collection and storage, a second phase of conceptual modelling and a third phase of data analysis.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgr010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157819","reasonableness and proportionality in legal decisions;forensic statistic;legal conceptual modeling;legal data management","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Such a 3-D trademark for the shape of a consumer product constitutes an attractive asset for a manufacturer, since such trademark protection-unlike design or patent protection, for example-is potentially infinite in duration. At the same time, a 3-D trademark provides the manufacturer with a monopoly on such a shape for certain goods, allowing it to effectively prosecute infringements by competitors. This article will provide some basic guidance in light of recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) related to the hurdles companies must overcome to register the shapes of their products as 3-D trademarks in the EU.","2162-2256","","10.1109/MCE.2016.2590221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7575788","","Shape;Trademarks;Companies;Consumer electronics;Consumer products;Europe;Monopoly","consumer products;trademarks","three-dimensional shape registration;consumer products;European Union law;EU law;3D trademark;trademark protection;Court of Justice-of-the European Union;CJEU","","","","","","26 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To achieve this, we incorporate semantic features by using the word segmentation to recognize single word terms, then leverage the improved C-value and heuristic methods such as word formation pattern and word formation power to evaluate candidates at both levels. By validating our approach with several existing dictionaries, a significant improvement of compound terms detection is achieved.

In this work we provide a bibliometric network analysis of Deep Learning publications (formerly Neural Networks) applied to the analysis of legal documents. Our study includes a total sample of 138 works published between 1987 and 2020 that used DL as primary methodology. We focused on three specific objectives: identification of the journals with more publications on the subject, a co-authorship network analysis, and an examination of the most cited works. Our results show that the publications are concentrated in a small number of specialized journals on the topic, and consequently, the number of works that use DL methodologies in the legal context is smaller compared to other areas. The co-authorship network analysis reveals four broad clusters of researchers that are time-dependent concentrated into Connectionism (1), Neural Networks (1) and Deep Learning (2). Our analysis of highly cited publications delivered 10 articles with two particular authors that centralize the network. Finally, we have found that collaboration between groups of researchers from different areas is minimal, showing a window of opportunity to increase interdisciplinary research, particularly between computer and legal research groups.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377970","Deep Learning;Neural Networks;bibliometric;legal;applications","Deep learning;Text analysis;Law;Bibliometrics;Neural networks;Collaboration;Big Data","","","","","","67","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Requirements engineers have begun to model privacy requirements based on taxonomic classifications of privacy. Independently, legal research has modeled privacy harms in a taxonomic fashion. In this paper, we compare a requirements engineering taxonomy of privacy protections and vulnerabilities to a legal taxonomy of privacy harms. We seek to determine the extent to which the concepts and terminology are consistent between the two taxonomies. A consistent, standard vocabulary for privacy concepts for both requirements engineers and lawyers will improve the common understanding of privacy concepts, legal traceability and compliance auditing. We conclude that the taxonomies we analyzed are reasonably compatible. We believe this compatibility indicates that a taxonomic understanding of privacy is a promising area of research for requirements engineers.","","978-1-4244-4085-6","10.1109/RELAW.2008.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797465","","Privacy;Taxonomy;Law;Legal factors;Software systems;Medical services;Government;Computer industry;Protection;Terminology","data privacy;security of data;systems analysis","requirements-based comparison;privacy taxonomies;privacy regulation;software systems;requirements engineers;model privacy requirements;taxonomic classifications;legal traceability;compliance auditing","","4","","15","","4 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Manufacturers and producers of these products are now taking the benefits of the internet to market them as they could easily reach a large number of potential buyers and end-users. In fact, internet advertising has globally become one of the favourite models of advertising with the rise of digital equipment and media in particular smart phones and other gadgets which enable access to the internet. The problem arises when some online advertisements including those published on social media are found to be illegal, misleading and deceptive as it contains inter alia, dubious or unproven claims in relation to the use and efficacy of herbal and traditional medicines. From regulatory perspective, all type of dissemination of information about products and health services including to market the products online are classified as advertisement. In Malaysia, the approval from Medicine Advertisements Board (MAB) under the Ministry of Health (MOH) is required before the advertisement can be published to the public. This paper uses doctrinal legal research method in examining the current issues and challenges revolving around illegal and misleading advertisements of herbal and traditional medicines. It then proceeds to discuss the relevant regulatory framework to address those issues, in particular the important role played by MAB. Relevant legislations from Australia, United States (US) and European Union (EU) are also explored for the purpose of emulating best practices with a view to enhance the existing legal mechanism in Malaysia.

The rules on the collection of evidence are exclusively stipulated in Paragraph 2 of Article 40 of the Supervision Law. Therefore, the identification of the connection among “threat”, “enticement”, “fraud” and “psychological coercion” should be based on the interpretation of this legal text. Furthermore, the specific connotations of “threat”, “enticement”, “fraud” and “psychological coercion” in a supervision process should be specified, current judicial situation should be studied using database of legal from the perspective of empirical research, the connection among “threat”, “enticement”, “fraud” and “psychological coercion” in the evidence collection procedure of a supervision process should be sorted out, and the scope for the exclusion of illegal evidence should be defined reasonably, so as to promote the rule of law across the country.","","978-1-7281-9623-7","10.1109/ICMEIM51375.2020.00098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384803","supervision law;evidence collection methods;psychological coercion;big data","Law;Databases;Education;Psychology;Legislation;Big Data;Information management","","","","","","31","","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ensuring system and organizational compliance is both more important and more difficult than ever before, as the penalties have become more severe, and regulations more complex and nuanced. This also presents substantial difficulties for multi-national companies, as different states, countries, or regions do not adhere to a uniform standard, resulting in a mixed set of regulations for the systems they govern. In this work, I describe a framework to address this issue, referred to as requirements water marking, wherein requirements from different jurisdictions that govern the same system may be evaluated and reduced to a single standard of care, establishing a “high water mark” for regulatory compliance and reducing requirements complexity. The framework, which draws on work in requirements specification languages and requirements comparison, allows engineers and legal experts to systematically simplify compliance and determine both high and low standards of care, while maintaining traceability back to the original legal text. In addition, I investigate the proposed value of legal requirements models, demonstrating the relationship between proposed value of these models to organizational decision-making and the validity of the model.","2332-6441","978-1-4673-5765-4","10.1109/RE.2013.6636760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636760","","Law;Organizations;Standards organizations;Industries;Conferences","data privacy;formal specification;formal verification;international trade;legislation;organisational aspects;security of data;specification languages;watermarking","security regulations;privacy regulations;personal information;organizational compliance;multinational companies;requirements water marking;regulatory compliance;requirements complexity;requirements specification languages;legal experts;organizational decision making;model validation","","1","","31","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As soon as judicial decision has an increasing repercussion, our hyper-connected society and social networks on the Internet take a relevant influential role, giving a never before seen feedback to the Judiciary. Easy access to case law, jurisdictional texts and judicial decisions in electronic form are elements with great impact, surpassing traditional publicity. An interesting case of study related to electronic media, and particularly through social networks, has been the dissenting vote of the rape case called “The Wolfpack”, known as “La manada” in Spain, that has crossed the borders of electronic protests to the streets, with demonstrations and reactions against it, particularly from feminist movements. Our hypothesis is that dissenting vote as an eSociety conceptualization has an electronic-digital component whose easy diffusion through the Internet makes it different from the traditional concept. It changes from being an ordinary procedural mechanism within a restricted scope of decision, to opening a debate at citizenship level. It involves nuances on transparency in the digital society, and of course in the idea of Open Justice as part of Open Government initiatives. As a field experience and methodological system, we will use electronic justice ICT tools, such as web-based HJ of the Constitutional Court of Spain and others to explore these considerations analytically.","2573-1998","978-1-7281-1704-1","10.1109/ICEDEG.2019.8734366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8734366","dissenting vote;eSociety;eJustice;Judiciary;eGovernment;Open government;digital society","Law;Social networking (online);Tools;Media;Internet;Gender issues","government data processing;Internet;law administration;social networking (online);social sciences computing","electronic media;social networks;dissenting vote;rape case;electronic protests;electronic justice ICT tools;votes;online posts;Spanish jurisdictional process;judicial decision;hyper-connected society;jurisdictional texts;electronic form;open justice;electronic-digital component;Internet;eSociety conceptualization;feminist movements;digital society","","","","10","","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The sheer number of laws increases the probability that some of these laws may contradict each other. In recent years in the City of Portland, many controversial instances of police officers using force have occurred. In this project we used formal verification and robot programming techniques to validate and find contradictions in laws that govern police use of force. We constructed a model of police officers and bystanders in a robot ""game"" using the NuSMV software and development language. Temporal logic, which uses a subset of modal logic, along with predicate calculus is used to produce a computational logic tree, which simulates all possibilities in the model. Robot movement is used to model state evolution. We inserted statutes and case law into our model to dictate the behaviors of the actors, in the process developing a formal method of translating laws into operational predicate modal logic clauses. Finally, we run a process to check through the computation tree to find contradictions. Our final results found several contradictions, some of them obvious enough to be used as argument in real court cases, and suggest the legal code should be seriously cleaned up so as to prevent confusion and uncertainty. Our work also suggests that formal verification techniques can be applied to drug laws, tax laws, and other legal venues.","2378-2226","978-1-4673-0908-0","10.1109/ISMVL.2012.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214781","NuSMV;Contradictions in Law;Formal Verification;Model-Checking","Law;Boolean functions;Force;Computational modeling;Computers;Data structures","criminal law;formal verification;police;robot programming;temporal logic","formal verification;robotic evolution;police rules of engagement;United States;police officers;robot programming;robot game;NuSMV software;development language;temporal logic;computational logic tree;operational predicate modal logic clauses","","","","28","","11 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this mapping and various metrics, we locate hot-spots in vehicular networks to determine the most vulnerable points for jamming. We also use these to optimize the placement of roadside units. To this end, we first develop quantitative measures for assessment of the importance of road segments in the context of security and traffic flow. We then use game theoretic analysis to investigate the effects of possible malicious users on the system for increased reliability and better management of resources. For example, we study the optimal deployment of traffic control and security infrastructure both in the static (roadside units) and dynamic case (law enforcement units).

The perspective is both legal and political, pointing out to the different legal solutions in the European Union and analyzing the development from a European integration perspective, particularly in terms of a so-called spill-over process, whereby integration in one field leads to integration in adjacent fields. We put forward two main arguments in this article: (1) We argue that in order for the spillover to succeed in a field crucial for national sovereignty such as criminal law, spill-over needs to be complemented with securitization and policy laundering, the latter referring to the phenomenon whereby issues are agreed at an international nonbinding arena in order to later introduce these “international standards” into binding legislation. (2) We argue that harmonization in the money laundering context provides an example of a successful spill-over enhanced by policy laundering and securitization; tackling money laundering ostensibly requires spilling over European integration also in the field of criminal law, a core issue of national sovereignty. A testament to this is the fact that European countries have even harmonized their criminalization of self-laundering, although punishable self-laundering has been previously considered contrary to the general doctrines and principles of criminal law in many countries. A case in point is Finland, the only country bound by the proposed directive where parties to the crime are not punished for money laundering, except in rare cases and there is no case law for self-laundering (Section 11 Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code of Finland).","","978-1-5386-9400-8","10.1109/EISIC.2018.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753065","European Union;criminal law;money laundering;spill-over;integration theory;securitization;policy laundering","","criminal law;legislation","European integration perspective;securitization;policy laundering;harmonization;money laundering context;European countries;punishable self-laundering;criminal law provisions;European Union","","","","32","","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The open government datasets to be mashed-up by developers may be subject to distinct licenses, legal notices, terms of use, and applicable law and regulations from multiple jurisdictions. Within this complex ecosystem there is a need to create semi-automatic tools supported by an ontology to help technical reusers of Public Sector Information to utilize datasets according to their intended purpose and in compliance with the legal obligations that govern the rights to reuse the data. Unfortunately, some researchers may avoid considering all the legal frameworks that apply in the domain of Open Government Data and limit their investigation to only the area of licenses. To enable wider, compliant utilisation of mashed-up open data, we have analysed the European Union (EU) legal framework of reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI), the EU Database Directive and copyright framework and other legal sources (e.g., licenses, legal notices, terms of use) that can apply to open government Datasets. From this deep analysis we now model several major concepts in an Ontology of Open Government Data Licenses Framework for a Mash-up Model (OGDL4M). There have been earlier ontologies for creative commons or open licenses, but they did not anticipate the other legal constraints that arise from Open Government regulations. The OGDL4M ontology will be used for qualifying datasets in order to improve the accuracy of their legal annotation. The Ontology also aims to connect each applicable legal rule to official legal texts in order to direct legal experts and reusers to primary sources. This paper aims to present the modules of the OGDL4M ontology in depth and to describe some preliminary evaluation.","","978-1-5090-6719-0","10.1109/CeDEM.2017.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8046278","open government data mash-up;licensing of open government data;legal ontology","Law;Ontologies;Licenses;Databases;Government;Terminology","copyright;government data processing;law administration;Linked Data;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","legal ontology;open government data mashups;Linked Open Government Data;Public Sector Information;mashed-up open data;European Union legal framework;EU Database Directive;copyright framework;legal sources;Open Government Data Licenses Framework for a Mash-up Model;OGDL4M ontology;legal annotation","","1","","34","","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The collaborative compliance approach utilizes information technology expected to build mutual trust in a new era of relations between taxpayers and tax authorities in increasing the tax ratio in Indonesia. During numerous disputes and misuse of tax invoices, tax reform was conducted by utilizing technology to provide convenience in implementing taxpayer's rights and obligations. Furthermore, using technology, it is expected to improve the quality of tax authority services. This research was conducted to analyze the Piloting Project of Tax Data Integration using Host-to-Host (H2H) e-Invoice to implement collaborative compliance as one of the government's efforts to implement smart governance to handle tax evasion issues. This research was conducted using a post-positivist approach with qualitative methods with innovation in the tax compliance concept. The data collection was carried out through in-depth interviews conducted through studies at PT X. The results showed that the application of the tax data integration program at PT X went quite well, viewed based on the dimensions of law enforcement, provision of facilities, and trust. In this case, law enforcement activities related to taxpayer supervision carried out better and more efficiently since there has been an increased competence of tax authorities in carrying out their duties. Providing tax facilities by providing convenience to the taxpayers may influence taxpayer compliance in carrying out its tax obligations. Facilities provision may also affect the dimension of trust where trust between actors leads to a better direction. The implementation of this program creates mutual trust and mutual understanding between PT X and tax authorities.","2640-0545","978-1-6654-0422-8","10.1109/ICISS50791.2020.9307587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307587","Smart Governance;Tax Data Integration;Value Added Tax (VAT);Host-to-Host e-Invoice;Innovations in Tax Compliance","Finance;Technological innovation;Government;Data integration;Monitoring;Law enforcement;Information technology","data acquisition;data integration;government data processing;government policies;taxation","Indonesia;information technology;mutual trust;tax authorities;tax ratio;tax invoices;tax reform;tax authority services;government;smart governance;tax evasion;tax compliance;tax data integration program;tax facilities;taxpayer compliance;tax obligations;host-to-host e-invoices;collaborative compliance;taxpayer rights;taxpayer obligations;H2H e-invoice;post-positivist approach;data collection;PT X;law enforcement","","","","25","","4 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This question has long been puzzling empirical legal scholars. Existing research typically studies case citation networks as a whole applying traditional network metrics stemming from graph theory. Those approaches are able to detect globally important cases, but since they do not take time explicitly into account, they cannot provide a comprehensive account of the dynamics behind the network structure and its evolution. In this paper we provide such a description, using two node importance metrics that take time into account to study important cases in the Court of Justice of the European Union over time. We then compare cases deemed as important by the metrics, with a set of 50 cases selected by the Court as the most important (landmark) cases. Our contribution is twofold. First, with regard to network science, we show that structural and time-related properties are complementary, and necessary to obtain a complete and nuanced picture of the citation network. Second, with regard to the case law of the Court, this study provides empirical evidence clarifying the motivation of the Court when selecting the landmark cases, revealing the importance of symbolic and historical cases in the selection. In addition, the temporal analysis sheds new light on the network properties specific to the landmark cases that distinguishes them from the rest of the cases. We validate our results by providing legal interpretations that sustain the highlights provided by the proposed network analysis.","","978-1-5090-2846-7","10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7752308","Citation networks;Directed acyclic graphs;Relative in-degree;Average longevity;Authority scores;European Court of Justice","Law;Europe;Context;Measurement;Electronic mail;Web search","directed graphs;law administration;network theory (graphs)","network analysis;complementary metrics;legal system;node importance metrics;Court of Justice;European Union;network science;citation network;landmark cases;symbolic cases;historical cases;temporal analysis;network properties;legal interpretations","","3","","25","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through the GDPR, individuals are able to better control their personal data in the face of new technological developments. While the GDPR is highly advantageous to individuals, complying with it poses major challenges for organizations that control or process personal data. Since no automated solution with broad industrial applicability currently exists for GDPR compliance checking, organizations have no choice but to perform costly manual audits to ensure compliance. In this paper, we share our experience building a UML representation of the GDPR as a first step towards the development of future automated methods for assessing compliance with the GDPR. Given that a concrete implementation of the GDPR is affected by the national laws of the EU member states, GDPR's expanding body of case law and other contextual information, we propose a two-tiered representation of the GDPR: a generic tier and a specialized tier. The generic tier captures the concepts and principles of the GDPR that apply to all contexts, whereas the specialized tier describes a specific tailoring of the generic tier to a given context, including the contextual variations that may impact the interpretation and application of the GDPR. We further present the challenges we faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future directions for research.","","978-1-7281-2536-7","10.1109/MODELS.2019.00-20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906896","General Data Protection Regulation, Regulatory Compliance, UML, OCL.","","","","","3","","35","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Malaysian scientists must increasingly be aware that genetic engineering can either be used for benevolent or malevolent purposes triggering the dual use dilemma. This is because certain materials, information and technology can not only be utilized for military and civilian purposes but also for criminal and terrorist activities. Therefore, this research has the purpose of examining the actions to be taken by Malaysia to censor the forms, methods, results and acquisition of knowledge of genetic engineering from being misused. Underlying Malaysia's actions is the bioethical principle, that is, the duty to prevent harm which is relevant to this research. It is proposed that the actions Malaysia should take are to be embedded within provisions of the Biosafety Act 2007 and its regulation. The method relied for this research is one that is qualitative in analyzing primarily the Biosafety Act 2007, international organization documents from websites, a case law and secondary resources. The results from this research indicate that the Biosafety Act 2007 can be utilized in order to achieve the said purpose of this research through existing provisions while in certain instances, amendments to some provisions which are unclear or inadequate together with the Biosafety (Approval and Notification) 2010 Regulations needs to be done.","","978-1-4673-4617-7","10.1109/CHUSER.2012.6504271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504271","Genetic engineering;laboratory biosecurity;bioethics;bioterrorism;Biosafety Act 2007","","biohazards;biotechnology;ethical aspects;genetic engineering;government policies;terrorism","Biosafety Act;bioethical principle;biotechnology;genetic engineering activities;bioterrorism;biosecurity measurement","","1","","40","","27 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Integration of UAS in existing air traffic management systems connotations and consequences","I. A. Wilson","Airspace Operations Efficiency, Boeing Research & Technology, Chantilly, VA","2018 Integrated Communications, Navigation, Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","14 Jun 2018","2018","","","2G3-1","2G3-7","The current airspace rules have evolved over a century of manned flight. This is not to say that they are ideal but they are known and all operators apply them. This paper examines the issues raised by integrating UAS in the existing `air traffic management systems' and airspace, and, the connotations of the integration and the subsequent consequences for both manned and unmanned aircraft. `Integration' means fitting in with the current operators in the airspace and with those users' rules and behaviors. It does not mean setting up UAS reservations, otherwise known as UAS Traffic Management; nor does it mean adding new rules and regulations that limit the existing manned aviation operations. An indication of the size of the problem in the USA is that there are 230,000 manned aircraft; fixed, wing, helicopters, gliders etc., but there are already 770,000 UAS registered with the FAA (not including those unregistered purchased on EBAY or `toy' stores) So the UAS being integrated are three times more than manned, but the value of the manned aviation sector to the USA is 1.8% GDP and cannot be hazarded. So manned/unmanned integration must be well planned. Yet it is apparent from SESAR and NextGen that the current ATM systems and their ConOps are at their scalability limit adding more aircraft will lead to delays and potentially reduce safety. Even the definition of the airspace is being challenged. It is unclear whether the FAA actually has authority to regulate aircraft operations below 500ft or 400ft or 83ft dependent on which case law is used. Neither is it clear whether State or City laws have precedence over FAA regulation. If deliveries by `drone' are a commercial use case, then not being able to descend below 83ft above ground is a significant limitation that cannot be overcome by throwing money. Existing manned operators are clear that at low level they are in Class G airspace where the Rules of the Air and Visual Flight Rules pertain. But UAS cannot fly Visual Flight Rules so they will fly `Detect and Avoid'. The Rules of the Air require a pecking order of aircraft type avoidance precedence based on seeing and identifying the aircraft type. UAS cannot `detect' the aircraft type so cannot apply the Rules of the Air for example; the flight rules require that a Predator must avoid a hang glider but it cannot sense the other aircraft type so cannot obey the rules of the air. In mandatory IFR airspace the UAS will be required to follow IFR; one of the IFR regulations is on loss of communications an aircraft should follow its last clearance to destination; not loiter or have a `lost link procedure'. Can an IFR UAS that has lost its link to the ground station fly the remainder of the mission including fitting in with an arrival sequence? This paper proposes an approach that could allow the number of aircraft operating be raised by a factor of four and still be safe to operate. The approach fits with the proposed ConOps from SESAR and NextGen of using Trajectory Based Operations. All aircraft would be treated equally whether manned or unmanned but would also be required to follow the same ConOps. It is achievable as it considers that an aircraft is an aircraft regardless of whether it has a pilot on board, and the connotation is that all aircraft should be treated equally but the consequence is that they must all meet the same basic level of capability. The impact on UAS avionics architectures and operations are highlighted and are significant. UAS can be integrated into the current ATM airspace but it will require significant changes in both the UAS systems and the systems analysis approach.","","978-1-5386-5679-2","10.1109/ICNSURV.2018.8384851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8384851","","Aircraft;Air traffic control;Visualization;Aerospace electronics;Instruments;FAA","air traffic control;aircraft;aircraft navigation;autonomous aerial vehicles;avionics;mobile robots","manned aviation sector;aircraft operations;aircraft type avoidance precedence;mandatory IFR airspace;IFR UAS;UAS systems;manned flight;unmanned aircraft;UAS traffic management;manned aircraft;ATM systems;visual flight rules;air traffic management systems;manned aviation operations;ATM airspace;airspace rules;manned-unmanned integration;SESAR;NextGen;ConOps;FAA regulation;drone;trajectory based operations;UAS avionics architectures","","5","","4","","14 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in small companies and development teams with short launch cycles, individuals with little or no legal training will be responsible for compliance. Two specific challenges commonly faced by non-experts are deciding if their system is covered by a law, and then deciding whether two legal requirements are similar or different. In this study, we assess the ability of laypersons, technical professionals, and legal experts to judge the similarity between legal coverage conditions and requirements. In so doing, we discovered that legal experts achieved higher rates of consensus more frequently than technical professionals or laypersons and that all groups had slightly greater agreement when judging coverage conditions than requirements, measured by Fleiss' K. When comparing judgments between groups using a consensus-based Cohen's Kappa, we found that technical professionals and legal experts exhibited consistently greater agreement than that found between laypersons and legal experts, and that each group tended towards different justifications, such as laypersons and technical professionals tendency towards categorizing different coverage conditions or requirements as equivalent if they believed them to possess the same underlying intent.","2332-6441","978-1-4799-3033-3","10.1109/RE.2014.6912269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912269","legal requirements;compliance;statutory interpretation;legal coverage","Law;Training;Standards;Mobile communication;Companies","law;software engineering","legal expertise;legal requirements;government laws;government regulations;software systems;software requirement process;layperson ability;technical professionals;legal experts;legal coverage conditions;consensus-based Cohen kappa","","3","","39","","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
